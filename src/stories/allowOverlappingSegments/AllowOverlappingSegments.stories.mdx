## Allow overlapping segments

If some items are overlapping, the gantt diagram doesn't display them overlapped. It puts them one beneath the other. 

This can be changed by setting the `allowOverlappingSegments` to `true`.

## `Timeline`
  <ArgsTable of={Timeline} sort="none" include={["allowOverlappingSegments"]}/>
